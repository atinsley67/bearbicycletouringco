It's been a busy time here at Bear Bicycle Touring Co. If you've been following us on social media, you'll know we've been riding our bikes a lot and exploring some excellent places, but we've been working hard on some exciting developments too.

If you're reading this, you've probably realized that our website has changed somewhat from it's first iteration. We're excited to have this blog space where we can post our thoughts thanks to Alex's dubious web development skills, but also the main content of the site has changed to reflect what's been going on for us recently.

Other than that, the biggest bit of news is that we've decided to add a fairly major addition to our bicycle touring offering: one day or half day tours where we provide you with a bike to ride. In time for the start of June, we'll have a fleet of awesome cyclocross bikes. For this who know what I mean by that, you'll know that they are a great general purpose class of bikes; with the riding style of a road bike but the tires of a bike suited to mixed surfaces, they are good for riding on pretty much any surface apart from technical mountain bike trails. For those who don't know what a cyclocross bike is, don't be put off if they sound a bit too race oriented. We're sure that pretty much anyone can step up to the challenge and take on one of our shorter tours on one of these bikes - you might be amazed how you can ride on a faster bike.

To add to the excitement we've got exclusive teeshirts arriving soon - you'll need to come on a tour with us to buy one! We also have some sweet Bear Bicycle Touring cycling kit coming, thanks to Vie13 Kustom Apparel.
