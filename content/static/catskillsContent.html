    <h1>Camping in the Catskills</h1>
    
    <h3>4 Day Bike Tour - <a href="contact">contact us</a> to claim your place</h3>
  
    <p>Get put some miles under your tires between yourself and civilization. Climbs, descents, quiet scenic routes through the mountains, and the natural tranquility of some excellent wild camping, join us and get away from it all in the Catskills, NY.</p>

    <p>We'll be supported by a vehicle carrying your off-the-bike wear and tent you provide so you're ready to set up camp once you reach the campsites. It'll also be carrying enough spare tubes, tires, wheels, food and clothing for bad weather to keep us up and running whatever the road throws at us.</p>
