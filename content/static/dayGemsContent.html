    <p>
      Lose yourself in the endless back-lanes of the New Jersey countryside as we wind our way through rolling hills and farmland. This tour is on paved road only; if you rent our bikes, they will be fitted with slick road tires.
    </p>

    <p>This tour is aimed at riders who are familar with riding on the road for several hours over the course of a day.
    Over the course of the morning we'll have left Lambertville well behind and ranged North to discover some of the gems of New Jersey.</p>

    <p>
      This day tour departs at 9.00 am. Private tours can be arranged at your chosen start time for groups of a minimum size of 4.
    </p>

      <li>Stop for lunch at the 'Clean Plate' in picturesque Clinton and enjoy a view overlooking the most photographed spot in New Jersey</li>
      <li>Dive back into the countryside as we make our way back towards the Delaware River</li>
      <li>Stop off in Frenchtown for a cafe break</li>
      <li>Arrive back in Lambertville for dinner</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bring your own bike or rent one of our cyclocross bikes</h2>

    <p>
      Our bikes are unique and not like the traditional beach cruisers you find on the tow path. Our bikes are lighter, have a more aggressive feel and have a more agile handling making them ideal for both the canal path and the roads. We will make sure you are comfortable on your bike before setting off!
