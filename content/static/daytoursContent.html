      We have different tours geared towards your ability ranging from 20 miles to 55 miles. Our rental bikes are great for riding on the canal towpath, the road or dirt country lanes. If you’re new to riding they offer the fun challenge of a more sporty ride that we think anyone can give a go on one of the shorter tours, but are also great for plugging away the miles on our longer rides too.

      One thing a many cyclists know is the love of coffee and cake stops while out on a ride. We know the best out there and all of our tours feature stops en route to help you refuel and enjoy the day out.

      The Delaware River Valley and surrounding countryside is stunning and rich in history. The history of the River Towns dates back to before the USA was formed. New Hope was once called Coryell's Ferry, after the local Ferry operator in town. In 1790 a huge fire occurred and the reconstruction of the town was seen as “new hope” and the name took. George Washington crossed the Delaware River to win the Battle of Trenton which occurred just east of Lambertville and was a turning point in the Independence War. Take the River Towns Tours and learn about the history of six Towns as well as exploring country lanes and enjoying lunch.

      Have you come to the area for the antique shops? Great! We can combine your interest of shopping and make your main mode of transport a bike. Peddler’s Village is not far away and is a colonial feel town with 62 antique shops! On the way there enjoy the ride and take in the tow path and country roads and stop by an old general store where coffee and cake will be available. If this sounds appealing check out The Canal, Road and Shopping Tour.

      Our final tour offering is for the avid cyclist. Do you want to get our for a long day on the bike and really explore the surrounding countryside? Journey on roads that make you feel transported to Europe and get lost in them as you end up in the picturesque town of Clinton. You will enjoy a scrumptious lunch before hopping back on the bike putting the miles back under the tires. Check out the NJ Countryside Tour for more details.
