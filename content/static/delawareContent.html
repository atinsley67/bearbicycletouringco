    <h3>4 day tours - <a href="contact">contact us</a> to arrange a date for your tour</h3>

    <p>Join us for a 4 day journey venturing north from South East Bucks County into the Pocono mountains before returning to the start location.</p>

    <p>We'll be supported by a vehicle carrying your off-the-bike wear so you're ready to check into our accommodation at the end of the day. It'll also be carrying enough spare tubes, tires, wheels, food and clothing for bad weather to keep us up and running whatever the road throws at us.</p>

      <h3>The route:</h3>
      <p>All distances are approximate - we're always tweaking our routes as we explore more and find better roads for you to ride on!</p>
      <h4>Day 1 - Afternoon departure: Yardley to Clinton - 40 miles</h4>
      <p>Riding out of Yardley, PA on the Delaware river we cross at the famous Washington Crossing bridge. Striking out into some of the finer parts of the New Jersey countryside, we'll venture over the Sourland preserve and Hunterdon Plateau as we head north to our first stop in the charming town of Clinton.</p>
      <p>In Clinton, we'll ride right to the door of our hotel for the night. We'll take care of the bikes while you collect your luggage, find your room and enjoy a well earned shower after completing the first day of the tour. Meeting for dinner at one of the town's eateries, you can enjoy relaxing and sharing stories of the day on the bike. Unwind with a stroll to the unique and historic Lowthorpe bridge overlooking the town's picturesque mill and river, enjoy a drink or retire to your room for an early night.</p>
      <h4>Day 2: Clinton to Milford - 60 miles</h4>
      <p>Continuing our journey North across the top corner of New Jersey we start to home back in on the Delaware river. A scenic climb onto the Kittatinny mountain leads us into the secluded Kittatinny ridge area which takes us north to Dingman's Ferry where we cross at the historic bridge back in PA. We complete the day riding North East to Milford for some well earned rest and to contemplate the coming days.</p>
      <h4>Day 3: A Pocono adventure - 65 miles</h4>
      <p>We complete a wide arc through the Pocono mountain region on the day with the most climbing in the tour. Expect isolated feeling, long winding mountain roads and a sense of discovering the countryside in a way you'd not thought possible.</p>
      <h4>Day 4: Stroudsburg to Yardley - 65 miles</h4>
      <p>An early start will give us plenty of time to make the journey back south. One of the harder climbs of the trip out of Stroudsburg will wake up the legs before we roll down the scenic lanes following Martin's Creek towards Easton. From Easton we follow the Delaware's River Road all the way back south to Yardley. As we near the end of the trip, we'll pass Bowman's Hill Tower, overlooking the broad river in commemoration of George Washington's historic campaign. In the closing miles of the journey, coming into view will be the distinctive arches of the railway bridge linking Yardley and Trenton which we've grown to know as 'home bridge'.</p>
