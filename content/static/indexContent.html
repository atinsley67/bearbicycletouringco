    <h1>Bike tours based out of Lambertville, NJ</h1>

    <p>
      The world around us is full of hidden gems which we often overlook. If you are new to cycling or if you are already an avid cyclist we have a ride to suit you which will allow you to explore these gems from the seat of a bicycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our rides range from short half day tours which anyone can achieve while still offering a challenge, up to multi-day epic adventures. Our shorter tours are designed for all bike types, whereas our longer tours are designed for road bikes, staying on paved roads.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can bring your own suitable bike, or we recommend renting our versatile cyclocross bikes. These offer the opportunity for newer riders to try a more sporty ride, while also being suitable for more experienced cyclists to push harder. The bikes will be set up for all-road or paved road depending on the tour.

    <p>
      We live in a fast paced world and sometimes we forget to slow down and see the sights. When was the last time you took an afternoon to get away from your busy schedule to be out in nature? Imagine cycling through small country lanes passing farms along the route and ending up in an old historic river town. Pull up a chair and relax over coffee as you overlooking the river and indulge in a sweet snack. Close in to your destination at the end of the day and feel the sense of accomplishment that you alone powered yourself across the distance.

    <p>
      Or imagine having several days where your only mission is to get on your bike everyday out on secluded roads and get to your next destination. You cycle through valleys, along rivers, passing picturesque towns and sometimes over mountains and you can just pedal and take it all in. Feeling sore at the end of the day and unwinding over some delicious food and good conversation and reliving the events of the day before heading to a well earned night's sleep. You will be amazed what the human body is capable of and walk away feeling proud of yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Or yet you want to push yourself. You want some days and expertise to concentrate on making yourself faster and stronger. Let us push you and give you the right tools, drive and nutrition to meet your goals. Compete on mountain climbs and improve you strength while we monitor and give feedback on your performance.
