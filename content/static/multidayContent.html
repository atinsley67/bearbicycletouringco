    <p>There is something special about multi-day cycle touring. Maybe it's waking each morning with one mission - to reach your destination by propelling yourself under your own power across the distance. Perhaps it's losing yourself in the daily passage of miles under your tires. Definitely it's sharing the journey both on the bike and during the evenings while resting with your touring comrades. That's not to mention how much fitter you'll get, or our personal favorite - indulging in dessert with zero guilt!</p>

    <p>We recommend traveling with your own bike, but if this is not an option you can rent one of our bikes and just show up! Our bikes are aluminum frames with a carbon fork with disk brakes, set-up with 25mm road tires.</p>
